ReAX Documentation
==================

**ReAX** is the industryâ€™s first non-proprietary IP Control based on AV/IT standards.

The ReAX ecosystem is made up of a few different components:

- **ReAX OS** - The control operating platform built by Aurora that runs on all ReAX controllers.  The underlying OS may vary based on the hardware, but the end user experience is the consistent across all devices.
- **Control hardware** - embedded control processors that run the ReAX OS and provide physical ports for controlling devices.  These appliances typically take form as a standalone control processor, or a touch screen with the control processor embedded.
- **ReAX Core Studio** - Core Studio is robust programming software from Aurora.  Core Studio provides a WYSIWYG editor for GUI creation and a drag-and-drop code creation tool.
